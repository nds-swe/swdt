## Listen
:::note Task
Watch this 👇🏼

Then answer in a simple statement the following questions:

- Does it make sense to add a `CHANGELOG.md` to `spring-starter`?
  + If yes, why?
  + If no, why and how else will you document the project?

## Read
:::note Task
Read [semver.org](https://semver.org/) and agree its boring to read, yet again it is ❗️ crucial in our world!

Check these two videos to your extent to make sure you understood `semver`:

- [Package Versioning - Best Practices with Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si3eWq1yHXs)
- [Automated Semantic Version and Changelog Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M8tBWt8X5o)

## Code
:::note Task
Add Swagger to your `spring-starter` using [Setting Up Swagger 2 with a Spring REST API](https://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api) from _baeldung_.

- Step 8 _ff._ you do not have to do, they are too advanced and do not suit our use case for now.
- If you want to have a take at OpenAPI 3.0, try [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@hala3k/setting-up-swagger-3-with-spring-boot-2-a7c1c3151545).

### No password?

If you apply the changes correctly, your API should ask for a password to see the docs, go back to [spring-starter](spring-starter#securing-an-endpoint) to remember why.

```
.antMatchers("/swagger-ui/**", "/v2/api-docs", "/swagger-resources/**").permitAll()
```

👆🏽 will actually make your docs public, if you want that 😏

## Sample
