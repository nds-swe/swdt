## Use

We use cURL to get to know the [Task Client-Server]({{< ref "docs/tasks/client-server" >}}).

## Install

For the first tool [the link is provided](https://curl.se/download.html), for any further tool finding out the way to install will also be up to you.

## Get started

cURL is a command line utility, so you will need a terminal to use it.

Here is their official [manual](https://curl.se/docs/manual.html).

Try
```shell
curl -X GET https://nds-swe.github.io/swdt
```
to see if your curl works. The output of this query is obviously gibberish only parsable with a browser but at least you know you curled something.
