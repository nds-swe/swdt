## Container diagram

It is subject to discuss if the two frontend apps can be combined into one. Given that we want to have something to architect in this task it is viable to start separated. We can always refactor/revisit our design, challenge it and change it (that is the whole idea).

This diagram is already quite elaborate, advanced and guaranteed **not correct**. It was never challenged and also never pair-reviewed. These are two crucial factors.

Further iterations will carve out the perfect solution üíß! Good that I have it as code so I can change it easily.
