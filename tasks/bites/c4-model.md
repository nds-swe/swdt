# Context

The context diagram is not invented. Capable DevOps engineers engage with the product team (in this course the subject `RME`) to derive the context from the users needs.
For this task though you get a context diagram that has already been `developed`.

```plantuml
@startuml Context
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml
' comment change diagram
' left to right direction
skinparam linetype ortho

Person(client, "Client", "People that search and apply for jobs.")
Person(agent, "Agent", "People that offer and negotiate jobs.")
System(jinder, "Jinder", "Allows agents and clients to negotiate about job offers. Agents paste offers, clients choose and then apply for them.")
System_Ext(notification, "Notification System", "An external notification provider sending SMS, E-Mails and Push Notifications.")
System_Ext(linkedin, "LinkedIn", "An professional community platform storing candidates profiles and/or jobs.")

**Jinder** (short for **Job** T**inder**[^1]) is a virtual platform taking the successful _behavioral pattern_ of Tinder (swipe to match something) and ports it into the job world. The concept is simple.

[^1]: Tinder is a registered trademark ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to [tinder.com](https://policies.tinder.com/intellectual-property/intl/en), this is why this task is called **J**inder and the term _Tinder_ is only used for an explanatory reference.

* Agents post positions on the Jinder platform
* Clients browse and swipe positions (either signaling interest or dismissing them)
* Matched job positions get further triage by agent and client 
* Clients and agents can login using primarily their social login from _LinkedIn_[^2]

[^2]: [LinkedIn](https://brand.linkedin.com/policies)‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is of course also a registered trademark, but where we talk about using the real social login, so its not a problem as we just consume their system.

Jinder is a quick sorting tool only replacing the first step of the job search. As soon as an interesting position has been matched, the further process can not be shortened. Jinder will offer some 2021 steps to negotiate between agents and clients but in-person applications and good letters of intents can and will not be replaced (we are still professionals).

In the first version we use two external systems, as we learn in [DRY](/docs/theory/principles#do-not-repeat) we do not implement such things ourselves.

* An external notification system to send any form of notification with nice templates etc.
* LinkedIn to import and keep profiles up to date as well as using them as Identity Provider

## Container diagram
:::note Task
Derive a container diagram from the context. You may use any tool that you want, ranging from Microsoft Word‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to [PlantUML](/docs/tools/plantuml). Read in [C4 Modeling](/docs/techniques/c4-modeling) why in this lecture the choice of tool is second priority.
:::

Use the following bullets to make up your mind:

* A persistence will be needed (though we save as less data as possible on our side - we leverage LinkedIn and _DRY_)
* An API Application will orchestrate the traffic between users and the database as well as the external systems
* Clients primarily want to use Jinder over a mobile device
* Agents primarily use Jinder over a desktop

## Component diagram
:::note Task
Derive a component diagram from your container diagram.
:::

:::caution
You will not be able to get this straight today. This is on purpose. Refactoring and revisiting drafts (_kill your darlings_) is another skill we need to learn. We will _never_ - also not after twenty years - know the perfect architecture from the start. Let us now think of something, challenge it later and revisit our diagrams!

This will also show if we chose the right tool for the job.
:::

Now we zoom in another layer (and in the same move leave away the most outside layers).

Think of a basic setup of your **main container**(s). Do not look at me üëÄ, you chose your containers in the step before. Pick one of the containers and enlarge it with the üîé. With a very high chance you will also look at the `API Application`.

* Code will need to be separated into their matching **domains**
* It is common that external systems get abstracted through a facade - we learn later why
* You might want to add something that offers an API
* Connecting to the database from the container diagram should be done by a specific component so we can switch or update the database anytime
* It might make sense to send asynchronous notifications with a _Producer-Consumer Pattern_ - we will check in a future lesson why

Once more. You are left in the cold water on purpose so we can revisit our initial drafts and polish them after we have reviewed them with new knowledge. If we get it _right_ in the first try there is nothing to iterate over üîÅ
