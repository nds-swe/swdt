## Fin

This lecture marks the end of our syllabus. Mastering GraphQL is a big topic and does not fit into one lesson at all. Also, we might want to discuss one or the other additional topic as well as fill out questionnaires. This is why this lecture is kept as a hidden card and we will check GraphQL only, if there is _nothing left to do_.
