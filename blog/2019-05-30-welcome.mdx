Blog features are powered by the blog plugin. Simply add files to the `blog` directory. It supports tags as well!

Delete the whole directory if you don't want the blog features. As simple as that!

```mermaid
  graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

And a plantuml diagram also, fancy.


```plantuml Your title
class SimplePlantUMLPlugin {
    + transform(syntaxTree: AST): AST
}
```
